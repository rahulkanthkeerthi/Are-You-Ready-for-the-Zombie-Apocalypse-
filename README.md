# Are-You-Ready-for-the-Zombie-Apocalypse-

Project Description:

The zombies dataset was created for this Project based on emergency preparedness recommendations. It consists of 200 observations and 14 variables. The variables include personal characteristics like age and sex, zombie status, a description of the neighborhood each participant lives in, and measures of supplies. The aim is to develop a logistic regression model that predicts the probability of becoming a zombie based on personal characteristics like age and sex, type of neighborhood people live in, and what emergency supplies are available. Practice bivariate tests like chi-squared and t-test to identify the most relevant variables for the model, develop and run the model, check model assumptions, and use the model to predict the probability of becoming a zombie for friends, family.

Project Tasks:

•	Compare zombies and humans
•	Recode variables missing values
•	Selecting variables to predict zombie status
•	Build the model
•	Checking model assumptions
•	Interpreting assumptions and making predictions
